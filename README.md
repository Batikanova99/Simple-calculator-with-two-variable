Hello Guys,

You enter 2 variables whichs are a and b.
Then the program will ask you (topla,Çıkar,Çarp,Böl)
The program will work according to your answer
if you write "topla" program collect to 2 variables 
program subtraction to 2 variables if you write cikar
program  to 2 variables if you write cikar
program subtracts to 2 variables if you write cikar
program makes division if you write bol
